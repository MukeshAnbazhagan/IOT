The Objective of this experiment is to build a system or device that will measure the rate of the heartbeat of the human body and detect heart attack. The device must be able to monitor all the heart rate in continuous interval length of time, it is important for the device in a continuous interval length of time. It is important for the device to able to display the information regarding the heart rate to the patient on LCD screen as well. IOT enable healthcare professionals to be more watchful and connect with the patients proactively. Data collected from IoT devices can help physicians identify the best treatment process for patients and reach the expected outcomes. Effect of IOT in healthcare is bringing the IOT into medicine helps in stronger, healthier and easier patient care. From the implantation of medical devices to smart sensors, the IOT will speed up healthcare delivery, enabling doctors to spend less time on transportation, diagnose illnesses and communicate with patient.  Provides Real-Time Date. A critical component of diagnosing and   addressing medical issues is acquiring accurate information in a timely manner, Streamlines Tasks, Saves Time and Resources, Assists Research and May Reduce Physician stress.
